# Statistical Tests

This directory includes CSV files with experimental results that were used for the statistical tests mentioned in the paper "An Optimized Graph Transformer Network Attack Classifier".

Additionally, it contains a Python script, "anova_hsd_from_csv.py", which is used to do statistical tests to compare multiple models. It is used with a CSV file passed as argument. You can run it with both of the conda environments provided in the "Code/graph_approaches/conda_torch_environment.yml" and "Code/flow_approaches/conda_tf_environment.yml" files.

The outputs of the script when ran with each of the CSV files is included in the "Results" directory.
