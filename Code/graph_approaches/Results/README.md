# This directory stores results for the graph-based models

1. The Confusion Diagrams are stored in the Diagrams directory
2. The results are stored into files in the Pickle directory

We have our own execution results already placed in these directories. Additionally, the "Outputs" directory contains the final outputs of the scripts with the results.
